# Start a particular version of python by following commands

# py --list (all versions installed)
# py --list-paths
# py --version
# py -3.9 (start a session using particular python version)
# py - will use default verison of python

Floats do not have exact representation 
like 0.1 is represented as 0.9999999....
format(0.1,'.25f') 
# 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.2 // output is False

datatypes are objects
they have state and functionality
int is an object, uses __add__ to add a number
